## Introduction :
I am thrilled to share my incredible journey as a web development intern at Oasis Infobyte. As a passionate student actively seeking internship opportunities, I discovered Oasis Infobyte's web development program through LinkedIn. Without hesitation, I applied and was overjoyed to receive the confirmation email.

## A Unique Approach to Design :
During this internship, I adopted a comprehensive design process. Instead of diving straight into development, I first created Figma designs for all the websites. To ensure my designs were exceptional, I extensively researched on platforms like Dribbble and CodePen, drawing inspiration from professionals. This approach helped me craft unique designs that stood out. You can find the Figma file for my designs at Figma File Link.

## Utilizing Technologies:
Throughout the internship, I utilized various technologies, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, normalize.css, and JavaScript. It was the first time I incorporated ready-made stylesheets for custom buttons and other elements, which enhanced the overall aesthetic appeal of the websites.

## Project Highlights:
### Task 1: TempConverter
For the first project, I developed a temperature calculator capable of simultaneously converting between five different temperature units. You can access the TempConverter project at Temp Converter Project.

## Growth and Learning:
Participating in this internship allowed me to gain valuable experience with new technologies. The completion of these projects significantly improved my ability to develop responsive websites. Moreover, I enhanced my skills in utilizing Bootstrap effectively, leading to more efficient and visually appealing designs.

# Thoughts on Oasis Infobyte:
While reflecting on my internship, I must acknowledge my skepticism regarding Oasis Infobyte. The main website's appearance raised some concerns, and the requirement to pay a compulsory amount before submitting the project seemed questionable. However, I focused on my primary goal: skill improvement. Certificates and the reputation of the organization were secondary to my personal development.

## Update !
After conducting further research into Oasis Infobyte and its founders, I have arrived at a disconcerting conclusion. It appears that the company is operating a deceptive website under the guise of an official organization, utilizing a scheme designed to defraud unsuspecting students. Their modus operandi involves issuing certificates of negligible value in exchange for a seemingly insignificant sum of money. However, upon examining the broader landscape, it becomes evident that they are orchestrating a substantial scam. Notably, they boast an extensive following of over 82,000 individuals on LinkedIn, further perpetuating their fraudulent activities.
